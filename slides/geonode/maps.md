# Maps
Maps are comprised of various layers and their styles. Layers can be both local layers in GeoNode as well as remote layers either served from other WMS servers or by web service layers such as Google or MapQuest.

GeoNode maps also contain other information such as map zoom and extent, layer ordering, and style.
